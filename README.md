# Experiments

A place for me to learn, play, and experiment with different technologies that I
am interested in without having to worry about project names, public/private
repos, etc. --just one big monorepo for all the little things I tinker with.

Anything that I feel proud of or becomes more offical can be moved out into it's
own repo.
