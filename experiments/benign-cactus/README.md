Experiment with React, Turbolinks and Web Components

[react](https://reactjs.org/), turbolinks, webcomponent

The idea is to register a HTML element and when it gets added/removed from the
DOM we will initialize/destroy our react objects.

Maybe something like

```
<react controller="Something">
```
